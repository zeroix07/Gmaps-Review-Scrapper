Domino's Pizza,,,,phylisha,1,"I had an horrible experience ordering from this business. First of all I ordered food for me and my son during the Super Bowl, which I could understand how overwhelmed the workers must have been. I waited the 2 hrs for my delivery nonetheless. When my food was delivered the delivery guy told me I only had 1 box of pizza. When I clearly ordered two which said so on my receipt! Tells me to “hang on” and leaves me in the lobby with 1 box of pizza. 5 mins later came back to bring the other box & just left without me asking any questions. To then open up both pizza boxes with a missing slice of pizza. the damn delivery driver (who was on a bike btw) I called the store to report the issues and they told me sorry for any issues that they will try better next time and hung up on me. Smh My problem is the fact that this place is super unprofessional with how they handled things. Please don’t ever order from this location or your pizza might just show up missing from the dominoes delivery people. I just wish I could’ve gotten a refund and I’m so glad I didn’t tip him!",2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLIFRA51JddxhcE0WA5Mcma21NLo-NxX14iPSe1tNtRTBl51_0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo
Domino's Pizza,,,,Jessica Adjei,1,"I can’t believe I wasted my money on this. Cheesy bread looks and taste like garlic bread, no cheese at all. I also ordered Alfredo chicken and honestly I could have bought Ragu Alfredo sauce and make my own. Alfredo pasta tasted very bland with very little sauce. I advise anyone to think twice before ordering from here.",5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIP8daQNJNBoaoRHx0EUpZldIxTnNTTRJ8K5MDO8fZdIt1Yow=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo
Domino's Pizza,,,,Mariah Rodriguez,1,Friday I spent 50$ on pizza after a while I noticed my pizza said delivered and to which it clearly never was. I called over 5 times and was told it was in the way after two hours I told them to cancel my order to which they claimed they would. Obviously they never did & not even my bank would give me the money back because these aholes claimed they fulfilled my order I’m surprised they even have 2.5 stars! Would give them zero but it isn’t an option,2 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVCOWhAVHpKnhtqC70_bOkdLIWJI2GGZ74C8XGtRFhi3paWypwh=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo
Domino's Pizza,,,,Destiny Boateng,1,"This location is absolutely disgusting. From the customer service, to the workers. I ordered from this location New Years night around 10:05 and not only did they not deliver my food, but the manager hung the phone up on me multiple times. There wasn’t much that I could do since they were close to closing by the time they answered the phone, but my advice would be to order from another location. Theres a lack professionalism and good work ethic at this location!",3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVKw1F_MWH0IfSkkQwgba8Dp5dg4OXvLVc2G67KDj-SELt5Q3l8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo
Domino's Pizza,,,,Jorden Vasquez,4,"I go here quite often, the service isn’t all that bad I’ve seen worse. My food is always made correctly i had only one instance where my order was wrong but they fixed it and added a lil extra sauce to my cinna twists. So can’t complain much.",6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjURzST9MKm_JDYMZwQ1KQUCR0yjMnqE2Hb3-4pbVoaejB0wRuWm=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo

American Grill,,,,Matt G,5,"Traveled down to the city from upstate and this was some of the best fried chicken I’ve ever had and the service that was provided was out of this world. I’d highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Also, they make their own tequila and it’s also AMAZING.",a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVyvSzk-1BIHxbLY8-5ZE8z_UtBx85zIiKb8zPBT43G71XWDVk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4
